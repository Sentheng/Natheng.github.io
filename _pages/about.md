Hi! My name is Nathan Theng. I recently graduated from California State University, Fresno, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Physical Science. I was a President's Scholar in the [Smittcamp Family Honors College](https://fresnostatesfhc.squarespace.com/), as well as the College of Science and Mathematics [Undergraduate Dean's Medalist](https://www.fresnostatenews.com/2024/05/01/fresno-state-announces-2024-undergraduate-deans-medalists/) and the University's [Undergraduate President's Medalist](https://www.fresnostatecsm.com/nathan-theng-named-2024-presidents-medalist/#:~:text=Computer%20Science%20Major%20Nathan%20Theng,the%20best%20among%20our%20students.).

My current goal is become a full-time software or machine learning engineer. I hope to pursue a PhD in Computer Science/Machine Learning, Computational Mathematics, or Data Science in the near future to develop and better understand how we can leverage technology to enhance efficiency in medical research and financial trends/models. Ultimately, I aspire to become a research scientist at a public university while assisting start-ups in my free time. To that end, I am currently open to and actively seeking full-time positions in software engineering, data science, or deep learning.

Work and Research Experience
======
Professionally/Work-wise, I have been an academic tutor/mentor for the [Fresno State's Athletic Department](https://gobulldogs.com/sports/2016/6/8/sass-fres-sass-html) for the last three years, helping student-athletes achieve academic success in courses ranging from organic chemistry to the philosophy of AI. I also interned at the [Hub of Digital Transformation and Innovation at Fresno State](https://technology.fresnostate.edu/dxihub/index.html), where I spearheaded and delivered artificial intelligence projects to benefit students on campus. Additionally, I served as a Risk and Security Engineering Intern at [Northwestern Mutual](https://www.northwesternmutual.com/) for the Summer of 2024, working on creating data pipelines and web applications for cloud vulnerabilities.

Research-wise, My research experience began as a Summer Biomedical Intern for the [UCSF-Fresno's Endocrinology Department](https://fresno.ucsf.edu/endocrinology), where I studied trends in diabetic medication in relation to the Central Valley's socioeconomic barriers. I later became an Academic Research Associate - Lead for the [UCSF-Fresno's Emergency Medicine Department](https://emergency.ucsf.edu/ucsf-fresno), helping to enroll patients in various ongoing studies in compliance with IRB standards. Currently, I am a Research Assistant in the [Mario Banuelos Research Group](https://www.mbgmath.com/home) at Fresno State, where I am investigating neural network architectures to predict structural variants in low-quality genomic generational data.
