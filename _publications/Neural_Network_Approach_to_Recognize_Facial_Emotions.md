excerpt: 'Implemented small and large convolutional neural networks within MATLAB to detect eight different facial emotion labels which are trained on the CKPLUS and Natural Human Face Image for Emotion Recognition dataset. Based on hierarchical features in global and subtle cues, the model was tested with live-feed images from a computer web camera. The results indicated 44.34% and 49.23% accuracy for the small and large networks respectively.(Research Advisor: Dr. Amith Belman, Department of Computer Science) '

Facial emotion recognition received significant at- tention in recent years as a crucial component in human- computer interaction and biometric security. In this paper, a deep learning approach, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), was presented to automatically extract features from facial expressions for recognizing facial emotion.

Two neural network models were proposed, designed, and trained on two large and diverse datasets of facial images with their corresponding emotion labels: CKPLUS and Natural Human Face Image for Emotion Recognition. Hierarchical repre- sentation from facial cues was learned to achieve accurate classi- fication. The neural network architectures and hyper-parameters were optimized to enhance accuracy and performance.

The neural network was designed to learn hierarchical representations, capturing both global and subtle facial cues contribut- ing to accurate emotion classification. Different neural network architecturesâ€™ effectiveness and hyper-parameter optimization were explored to enhance model performance.

The results from the two neural network designs demonstrated a 44.34% and 49.23% accuracy in recognizing a diverse range of facial emotions: Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutrality, Sadness, and Surprise. Since the majority of facial emotion recognition relies on static images, these models were implemented with live-feed images via a computer web camera.
