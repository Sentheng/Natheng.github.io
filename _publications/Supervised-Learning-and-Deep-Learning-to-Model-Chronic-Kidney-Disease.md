excerpt: 'Proposed and implemented four supervised learning classification models, including one deep learning model (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-Layer Perceptron) to predict if an individual has chronic kidney disease based on a dataset with 25 different features. The Multi-Layer Perceptron model had the highest accuracy of 96.6% and the Decision Tree model had the lowest with 92.6%.(Research Advisor: Dr. Athanasios Panagopoulos, Department of Computer Science)'

The use of AI, specifically classification and prediction has gained significant attention in recent years in medicine and healthcare as it is crucial to predict early diagnosis of adverse disease and condition. With continuous traditional specific laboratory testing for diseases such as MRI and complete blood panels can be expensive and not as widely available to an individual rural area, super- vised learning techniques can be employed based on previous lab data to predict if an individual in prone to a certain disease. This paper presents four supervised learning techniques and models to predict specifically Chronic Kidney Disease.

The four supervised learning techniques and models are Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Deep Neural Network (MultiLayer- Perceptron). These four proposed models were trained on a data set specifically geared toward Chronic Kid- ney Disease with 24 different features and one target classification that will be pre-processed beforehand and split into training, testing, and validation data for the models to train and test on.

The results of the models were shown via a confusion matrix in which the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score were calculated along with the execution time for each model. The results demonstrated that the the deep neural network had the best performance with an F1 Score of 97.87% and 96.97% for pre- dicting if individuals had chronic kidney disease and individuals who did not have chronic kidney disease respectively. The neural network also had an execution time of roughly two seconds. The models that are used from the chronic kidney data set can be applied to other diseases and varying amounts of features to further advance AI in medicine.
