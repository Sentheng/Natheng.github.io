Created a statistical model using MATLAB to read a corpus of text in order to predict the next word in the sequence of given word preceding using an N-gram language modeling system. The model was trained and measured by counting how often word sequences occur and estimating their probabilities for prediction using unigram and bigram #For this project the text file for Moby Dick was used.

There are 10 different functions #1: Function to read the text file #2: Function to extract only the words #3: Function to count the number of words #4: Function to count the number of unique words #5: Function count the amount of unique words under a minimum amount #6: Function to get the number of occurrences of each word (unigram) #7: Function to get the matrix of the bigram #8: Function to generate the next text based on probability of the words using prior information #9: Function to improve automatic text generation by adding constraints #10: Function to plot the distribution of the words of the book
