We implement both neural network and binary classification machine learning models and assess their ability to identify the presence of a true deletion within an individualâ€™s genome. We compare the predictive analytics of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Logistic Regression in identifying such variation using genomics signals of related family members. We utilize a low-quality dataset containing information about the number of DNA fragments at specific genomic locations. The data used for our study was obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project and included information about a three-generation, 17-member family.
