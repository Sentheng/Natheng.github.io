title: "MNIST Handwritten Digits Analysis Project"
excerpt: "Created models using K-Nearest-Neighbors, K-Means, MultiPerception Layers, and a Convolutional Neural Network to analyze the MNIST Handwritten Digits. Users can pick of which of the following models to choose from to specify the accuracy of each model against each other. A confusion matrix is created as well to demonstrate the percentage of accuracy of each model. <br/><img src='/images/MNIST.png'>"

This project was created for use with the CSCI 164 course at California State University, Fresno. We utilized four different machine learning models to predict the handwritten digits: K-Nearest-Neighbors, K-Means, MultiPerception Layers, and a Convolutional Neural Network. This provides a well-rounded sense of how each machine-learning model works in further analyzing the data. Overall a very easy and efficient introduction to AI and machine learning.
