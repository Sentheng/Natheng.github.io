Two neural network models were proposed, designed, and trained on two large and diverse datasets of facial images with their corresponding emotion labels: CKPLUS and Natural Human Face Image for Emotion Recognition. Hierarchical representation from facial cues was learned to achieve accurate classification. The neural network architectures and hyper-parameters were optimized to enhance accuracy and performance. The neural network was designed to learn hierarchical representations, capturing global and subtle facial cues and contributing to accurate emotion classification. The results from the two neural network designs demonstrated 44% and 49% accuracy in recognizing a diverse range of facial emotions: Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutrality, Sadness, and Surprise.
